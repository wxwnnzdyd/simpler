/**
 * Backend-neutral distributed communication C API.

 * Provides primitives for multi-rank communication: init, create

 *
 * Implementations:
 *   onboard/host/comm_hccl.cpp — HCCL backend (links CANN hccl/hccl_fwk)
 *   sim/host/comm_sim.cpp      — malloc-based simulation
 *
 * All functions are compiled into libhost_runtime.so. The linker selects
 * the implementation at build time (onboard vs sim), with no runtime
 * dispatch or virtual functions.

/**
 * Allocate or derive a per-rank communication window for a subset of ranks.
 *
 * Unlike comm_alloc_windows() which creates the base communication window once
 * at bootstrap, this materialises a dynamically-derived domain (a subset of
 * the base communicator).  Multiple concurrent allocations are disambiguated
 * by `allocation_id`, which is mixed into every internal handshake / barrier
 * filename so a second allocation does not collide with the first.
 *
 * This is a collective operation across the subset only: every
 * participating chip must call this with matching arguments; non-members
 * of the subset do NOT call it.  Internal file barriers synchronise the
 * subset, so the parent (orchestrator) only needs to dispatch and wait
 * for completion — it does not need to broker the cross-rank handshake.
 *
 * On HCCL/a2a3 this performs aclrtMalloc + the same Path-D IPC pattern as
 * comm_alloc_windows but on a fresh per-allocation buffer.  On HCCL/a5 this
 * derives a slice from the base URMA window and reuses the base native URMA
 * workspace.  On sim it shm_opens a fresh POSIX shm scoped by `allocation_id`.
 *
 * Resources allocated here remain owned by the base handle; either an
 * explicit comm_release_domain_windows() or final comm_destroy(base)
 * frees them.
 *
 * @param h                       Base handle from comm_init().

 *                                unique among currently-live allocations
 *                                on this handle.
 * @param rank_ids                Base-communicator rank ids in dense
 *                                domain order (length rank_count).
 * @param rank_count              Number of subset members.
 * @param domain_rank             This caller's dense rank in the subset.
 * @param window_size             Bytes per rank.  Backend must allocate
 *                                exactly this size; no auto-rounding.
 * @param device_ctx_out          Receives a device pointer to a new
 *                                CommContext for the subset.
 * @param local_window_base_out   Receives this rank's local window start
 *                                address (for buffer carving on the

/**
 * @file scope_stats.h
 * @brief scope_stats streaming shared-memory data structures.
 *
 * Two ScopeStatsRecords are produced per scope — one at scope_begin and one at
 * scope_end — each carrying the task/heap ring start/end and the tensormap
 * live-entry count sampled at that boundary, plus the scheduler-published
 * dep_pool tail/top snapshot tagged with a phase flag. Records stream off the device in
 * fixed-capacity buffers, mirroring PMU / dep_gen / args_dump / chip_swimlane (the
 * single source of mgmt-loop truth is
 * src/common/platform/include/host/profiler_base.h):
 *
 *   ScopeStatsFreeQueue   — SPSC: Host pushes free buffers, AICPU pops them.
 *   ScopeStatsBufferState — Per-instance state: free_queue + current buffer ptr
 *                           + drop/total counters.
 *   ScopeStatsDataHeader  — Fixed header: per-thread ready queues + static
 *                           capacity metadata + fatal latch.
 *   ScopeStatsBuffer      — Fixed-capacity ScopeStatsRecord buffer.
 *
 * Single-instance: the orchestrator is one AICPU thread, so the BufferState
 * array has length 1 — kept array-shaped for symmetry with the other
 * collectors and to match ProfilerBase<ScopeStatsModule>::for_each_instance.
 *
 * Concurrency contract (SPSC, both directions single-side on each end — the
 * orchestrator thread is the only AICPU writer):
 *   free_queue  — Host producer  / AICPU consumer.
 *   ready_queue — AICPU producer / Host consumer.
 * The host collector thread DOES read buffers concurrently with AICPU writing
 * other buffers; ownership of any single buffer is handed off atomically via
 * the queues.

// in-flight tasks, heap_end-heap_start is bytes in use, and
// dep_pool_end-dep_pool_start is live dependency-list entries. tensormap is a
// free-list pool (not a ring), so its current live-entry count is stored
// directly.

// padding.

"""Sliding-window moving average over runtime-allocated outputs.

``out[i] = mean(base[i], out[i-1], ..., out[i-WINDOW])``

Dense-fanin coverage for the orchestrator and scheduler. Every ``out[i]`` is a
runtime-allocated OUTPUT, so a later task reading it takes a Step-A creator edge
(``DEP_WAIT | DEP_RETAIN``) from ``owner_task_id``. The whole graph therefore
comes from dependency discovery — no explicit dependency is ever added.

Each task carries WINDOW producer edges where the rest of the scene-test corpus
carries at most 1.5, which is what this case exists to exercise:

- per-task fanin degree of 16 against a corpus maximum of 1.49
- producer fanout degree of 16, so the completion-time fanout walk is O(16)
  rather than O(1)
- dependency-pool occupancy proportional to the window rather than to a chain

Only ``i-1`` is non-transitive: ``T_{i-1}`` already reaches ``T_{i-2}`` through
``T_{i-WINDOW}``, so WINDOW-1 of every task's edges are transitively redundant,
all at submission distance <= WINDOW.

Predecessors that do not exist yet (``i < WINDOW``) are padded with ``base[i]``,
an external tensor with no owner, which contributes no edge.

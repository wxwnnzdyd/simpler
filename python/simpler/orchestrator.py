"""Orchestrator — DAG builder passed to a Worker submit/run callback.

A thin Python facade over the C++ ``Orchestrator``. The Worker creates one
Orchestrator handle at init, retrieves the C++ object via ``Worker.get_orchestrator()``,
and passes the handle to the user's orch function::

    def my_orch(orch, args, cfg):
        # chip_handle/sub_handle come from Worker.register(...)
        # build the args object yourself as Tensors; tags drive dependency inference
        a = TaskArgs()
        a.add_tensor(input_handle.tensor(shape, dtype),  TensorArgType.INPUT)
        a.add_tensor(output_handle.tensor(shape, dtype), TensorArgType.OUTPUT)
        orch.submit_next_level(chip_handle, a, cfg, worker=0)  # handle from Worker.register(chip_callable)

        sub_args = TaskArgs()
        sub_args.add_tensor(output_handle.tensor(shape, dtype), TensorArgType.INPUT)
        orch.submit_sub(sub_handle, sub_args)

    handle = w.submit(my_orch, my_args, my_config)
    handle.wait()

Scope and submission-close lifecycle is managed by ``Worker.submit()``;
completion is managed by its ``RunHandle``. ``Worker.run()`` remains the
blocking ``submit(...).wait()`` compatibility entry point.

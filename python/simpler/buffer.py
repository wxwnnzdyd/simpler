"""Owner/consumer side of the Buffer ABI.

The three wire types — ``CanonicalIdentity``, ``BufferDescriptor`` and ``Tensor`` — are the C++
structs of ``buffer.h`` bound directly, so there is one definition of the layout and one validator
(``validate_tensor``) behind every boundary that builds or decodes one. This module re-exports them
and adds what is inherently host-side: ``Buffer``, which owns a POSIX shm, the constructors that wrap
a backing as one, and ``ImportRegistry``, the consumer's map-once cache. Transporting a ``Tensor``
is the TaskArgs mailbox blob's job and lives in ``task_args.h``, not here.

``CanonicalIdentity`` is fixed-length (opaque ``owner_instance_id`` + ``buffer_id`` + ``generation``)
so hashing and comparison cannot read past it whatever arrives on the wire. The owning worker's tree
path is **not** part of the identity: it is interned to a diagnostic ``owner_worker_path_id`` whose
side table lives only in the owning process.

    device backing at a host endpoint resolves to ``OWNER_DELEGATED_COPY`` when this endpoint has a
    delegation channel to its owner, and is refused only when it has none (a SUB child, or another

    ``device_owner_instance_id`` names that Worker; ``deployment`` says which side of it this

    ===================  =================  =========================================
    endpoint             deployment          relation to a Buffer carrying that nonce
    ===================  =================  =========================================

    the Worker itself    HOST_CPU            it OWNS those chips -> OWNER_DELEGATED_COPY
    Python SUB child     HOST_CPU (no nonce) no relation at all -> refused
    ===================  =================  =========================================

    The two host rows are distinguished by the nonce: neither can hold a device VA, and only the
    owning Worker can still reach the Buffer by driving the chip's control mailbox. A nonce that
    does not match names a different Worker's device memory and is refused from every endpoint.

    This is Worker-grained, not chip-grained: the nonce is minted once per Worker incarnation (in
    ``Worker.init()``), not once per chip, so a Worker with several ``device_ids`` gives all its
    chip children the same one — the wire ``BufferDescriptor`` has no field that distinguishes
    siblings (``owner_worker_id`` is owner-side free/copy provenance, never serialized). A backing
    minted for chip 0 therefore also passes here on sibling chip 1. The exact-chip half is
    ``Worker._child_prov_check_dispatch_locked``, which compares the private registered snapshot's
    ``owner_worker_id`` against the submitted target and holds that authorization through native
    submit. The chip-side nonce check is a backstop, not a replacement for the exact-worker gate.

    DEVICE-backing refusals are tagged ``RegionAccessReasonCode.UNSUPPORTED_ENDPOINT_RELATION``
    (``comm_endpoints.py``) — the same reason code the domain-scoped
    ``EndpointRegistry``/``RegionAccessService`` engine reports for the same question at
    region-planning time. The two mechanisms share only that vocabulary, not a live registry
    object: this context is built inside forked child processes (and at L2's same-process
    lazy-materialize point), both of which run before ``EndpointRegistry.from_snapshot()``'s
    ``_require_ready_for_region_planning()`` precondition can be assumed to hold. That registry's
    topology snapshot also carries no per-chip Buffer ownership field, so it could not close the
    Worker-grained-not-chip-grained limit above even where it is reachable. ``deployment`` is the
    shared physical-query input; it is not a second endpoint capability table.
